title: On valuing long duration energy storage and energy carrier trade in net-zero energy systems
---
I wrote a thesis under Prof. Jeffrey M. Bergthorson at McGill University on the electricity system costs we could avoid if we had long duration energy storage. With it, we wouldn't need to build as much solar, wind, and batteries. If you're reading this, you have an advance copy. 

Tangents, corrections, a deluxe edition, and bite-sized findings to come in the future!
