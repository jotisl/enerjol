We need to transform our energy systems. They cause most of our greenhouse gas problem, but are central to an advanced civilization. I believe the goal is to get enough energy to prosper, but to harness the stocks and flows of Earth without making it inhospitable in the process.

This website is thus a repository for my work, research, and analysis. If that wasn't clear, views are entirely my own.
