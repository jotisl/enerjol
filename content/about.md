I study and (aspire to) work on energy systems, which are most of our greenhouse gas problem. 

I just finished a master's at McGill University modeling long-duration energy storage and energy carriers, in the [Alternative Fuels Laboratory](https://alternativefuelslaboratory.ca/). Before that, I spent a few years going up and down the engineering R&D pipeline through student rocketry, internships, and research during my undergrad in mechanical engineering.

I love parentheticals, but they clutter sentences. My antidote is to delete them elsewhere and tend to them here.
