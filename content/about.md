I study (and [work on](https://bep.brookfield.com/)) energy systems, which are most of our greenhouse gas problem. 

I just finished a [master's](https://enerjol.com/mscthesis/) at McGill University modeling long-duration energy storage and energy carriers, in the [Alternative Fuels Laboratory](https://alternativefuelslaboratory.ca/). Before that, I spent a few years going up and down the engineering R&D pipeline through [student rocketry](https://mcgillrocketteam.com/media-gallery), [intern](https://www.wsp.com/fr-ca)[ships](https://www.reactiondynamics.space/en/home), and research during my undergrad in mechanical engineering.

I love parentheticals, but they clutter sentences. My antidote is to delete them elsewhere and tend to them here, in margin sidenotes that took me entirely too long to design.
